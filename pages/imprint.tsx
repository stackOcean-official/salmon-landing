        Liability for contents
      </h3>
      <p className="py-4">
        As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these
        pages in accordance with § 7 paragraph 1 TMG under the general laws.
        According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, we are not obligated to monitor transmitted
        or stored information or to investigate circumstances that indicate
        illegal activity.
        <br />
        Obligations to remove or block the use of information under the general
        laws remain unaffected. However, liability in this regard is only
        possible from the point in time at which a concrete infringement of the
        law becomes known. If we become aware of any such infringements, we will
        remove the relevant content immediately.

        Liability for links
      </h3>
      <p className="py-4">
        Our offer contains links to external websites of third parties, on whose
        contents we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot assume any liability
        for these external contents. The respective provider or operator of the
        sites is always responsible for the content of the linked sites. The
        linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of
        linking. Illegal contents were not recognizable at the time of linking.
        <br />
        However, a permanent control of the contents of the linked pages is not
        reasonable without concrete evidence of a violation of the law. If we
        become aware of any infringements, we will remove such links
        immediately.
