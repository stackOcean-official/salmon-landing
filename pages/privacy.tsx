        3. general notes and obligatory information
      </h3>
      <p className="py-4">
        Data protection <br />
        The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data
        very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in
        accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and this data
        protection declaration. <br />
        When you use this website, various personal data are collected. Personal
        data is data with which you can be personally identified. This privacy
        policy explains what data we collect and what we use it for. It also
        explains how and for what purpose this is done. <br />
        We would like to point out that data transmission on the Internet (e.g.
        when communicating by e-mail) can have security gaps. Complete
        protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.{" "}
        <br />
        <br />
        Note on the responsible office <br />
        The responsible party for data processing on this website is: <br />
        <br />
        stackOcean GmbH <br />
        Kuhnkestr. 6 <br />
        24118 Kiel <br />
        Phone: +49 431 55682903 <br />
        E-mail: hello@stackocean.com <br />
        <br />
        The responsible party is the natural or legal person who alone or
        jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing
        of personal data (e.g. names, e-mail addresses or similar). <br />
        Storage period <br />
        Unless a more specific storage period has been specified within this
        data protection declaration, your personal data will remain with us
        until the purpose for the data processing no longer applies. If you
        assert a legitimate request for deletion or revoke your consent to data
        processing, your data will be deleted unless we have other legally
        permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g. retention
        periods under tax or commercial law); in the latter case, the data will
        be deleted once these reasons no longer apply. <br />
        Note on data transfer to the USA <br />
        Among other things, tools from companies based in the USA are integrated
        on our website. If these tools are active, your personal data may be
        transferred to the US servers of the respective companies. We would like
        to point out that the USA is not a safe third country in the sense of EU
        data protection law. US companies are obliged to hand over personal data
        to security authorities without you as a data subject being able to take
        legal action against this. It can therefore not be ruled out that US
        authorities (e.g. intelligence services) process, evaluate and
        permanently store your data located on US servers for monitoring
        purposes. We have no influence on these processing activities.
        <br />
        <br />
        Revocation of your consent to data processing <br />
        Many data processing operations are only possible with your express
        consent. You can revoke consent you have already given at any time. The
        legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains
        unaffected by the revocation. <br />
        Right to object to data collection in special cases and to direct
        marketing (Art. 21 DSGVO). <br />
        IF DATA PROCESSING IS CARRIED OUT ON THE BASIS OF ART. 6 ABS. 1 LIT. E
        OR F DSGVO, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR
        PERSONAL DATA AT ANY TIME FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR
        SITUATION; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE
        RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS
        PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL
        DATA CONCERNED UNLESS WE CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS
        FOR THE PROCESSING WHICH OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS,
        OR THE PROCESSING IS FOR THE PURPOSE OF ASSERTING, EXERCISING OR
        DEFENDING LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION UNDER ARTICLE 21(1) DSGVO).
        <br />
        IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA ARE PROCESSED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT MARKETING,
        YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL
        DATA CONCERNING YOU FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH MARKETING; THIS ALSO APPLIES
        TO PROFILING INSOFAR AS IT IS RELATED TO SUCH DIRECT MARKETING. IF YOU
        OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR THE
        PURPOSE OF DIRECT MARKETING (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 21 (2) OF THE
        GERMAN DATA PROTECTION ACT). <br />
        <br />
        Right of appeal to the competent supervisory authority <br />
        In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects shall have the
        right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular
        in the Member State of their habitual residence, their place of work or
        the place of the alleged violation. The right of appeal is without
        prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy. <br />
        <br />
        Right to data portability <br />
        You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the
        basis of your consent or in performance of a contract handed over to you
        or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you request
        the direct transfer of the data to another responsible party, this will
        only be done insofar as it is technically feasible. <br />
        <br />
        SSL or TLS encryption <br />
        For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential
        content, such as orders or requests that you send to us as the site
        operator, SSL or TLS encryption. You can recognize an encrypted
        connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from
        "http://" to "https://" and by the lock symbol in your browser line.{" "}
        <br />
        If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us
        cannot be read by third parties. <br />
        <br />
        Information, deletion and correction <br />
        Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the
        right at any time to free information about your stored personal data,
        its origin and recipient and the purpose of data processing and, if
        necessary, a right to correction or deletion of this data. For this
        purpose, as well as for further questions on the subject of personal
        data, you can contact us at any time. <br />
        <br />
        Right to restriction of processing <br />
        You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your
        personal data. For this purpose, you can contact us at any time. The
        right to restriction of processing exists in the following cases: <br />
        If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we
        usually need time to verify this. For the duration of the review, you
        have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your
        personal data. <br />
        If the processing of your personal data happened/is happening
        unlawfully, you can request the restriction of data processing instead
        of deletion. <br />
        If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it to exercise,
        defend or assert legal claims, you have the right to request restriction
        of the processing of your personal data instead of erasure. If you have
        lodged an objection pursuant to Art. 21 (1) DSGVO, a balancing of your
        and our interests must be carried out. As long as it has not yet been
        determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the
        restriction of the processing of your personal data. <br />
        <br />
        If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data -
        apart from its storage - may only be processed with your consent or for
        the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims or for the protection
        of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of an
        important public interest of the European Union or a Member State.

        <br />
        With the help of Plausible, we are able to collect and analyze data
        about the use of our website by website visitors. This allows us to find
        out, among other things, when which page views were made and from which
        region they come. We also collect various log files (e.g. IP address,
        referrer, browsers and operating systems used) and can measure whether
        our website visitors perform certain actions (e.g. clicks, purchases and
        the like). <br />
        <br />
        The use of this analysis tool is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO.
        The website operator has a legitimate interest in the anonymized

        YouTube with enhanced data protection <br />
        This website embeds videos of YouTube. The operator of the pages is
        Google Ireland Limited ("Google"), Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin
        4, Ireland. <br />
        We use YouTube in the extended data protection mode. According to
        YouTube, this mode means that YouTube does not store any information
        about visitors to this website before they watch the video. However, the
        transfer of data to YouTube partners is not necessarily excluded by the
        extended data protection mode. Thus, YouTube - regardless of whether you
        watch a video - connects to the Google DoubleClick network. <br />
        <br />
        As soon as you start a YouTube video on this website, a connection to
        the YouTube servers is established. This tells the YouTube server which
        of our pages you have visited. If you are logged into your YouTube
        account, you enable YouTube to assign your surfing behavior directly to
        your personal profile. You can prevent this by logging out of your
        YouTube account. <br />
        Furthermore, YouTube can save various cookies on your end device after
        starting a video or use comparable recognition technologies (e.g. device
        fingerprinting). In this way, YouTube can obtain information about
        visitors to this website. This information is used, among other things,
        to collect video statistics, improve the user experience, and prevent
        fraud attempts. <br />
        If necessary, further data processing operations may be triggered after
        the start of a YouTube video, over which we have no control. <br />
        YouTube is used in the interest of an appealing presentation of our
        online offers. This represents a legitimate interest within the meaning
        of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO. Insofar as a corresponding consent has
        been requested, the processing is carried out exclusively on the basis
        of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO; the consent can be revoked at any time.{" "}
